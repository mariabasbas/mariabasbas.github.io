<h2> <span style = "color:green"> School History </span></h2>
    
<li>What different schools have you attended, and in what places?</li>
    
    <p> I've attended a private school in Manila, for about 7 years (from kindergarten to grade 2) and then I moved to Thailand and I studied at the Regent's International School in Pattaya for about 5 years then I moved to China (Nanjing) then I studied in Nanjing International School for 2 and a half years and now I'm in my 4th school here in Hangzhou.
    </p>

<li>What teacher had the greatest influence on you? Why?</li>
    <p> My science teacher, Mr. Basaraba from NIS, I would call him Mr. B for short but he was an awesome science teacher. He taught me a lot of things and we both have an interest in Basketball. He's about 5"9 and he's american. I think he influenced me a lot beacause of all the inspiring talks he gives and also he believed me to do my best.
    </p>
    
<li>What are your favorite things to learn in school?</li>
        
    <p> I really like anything to do with creativity, like Art, Media or Design. I enjoy it and I'm really enthusiastic about it. For Art I really like learning different techniques, for Media I really enjoy taking pictures (photography and film) and for design I like to customize blogs, and also learn how to program a website.
    </p>
    
<li>What are the biggest challenges you have as a student?</li>
    <p> Not to procrastinate. It's really hard to stay on task especially at school because your friends are in school and you would be curious as to what they are doing. Also managing my own time, and make sure to give my work in on time.
    </p>
    
<li>What do you most want to make with the knowledge you will learn in this class?</li>
    <p> I wanna make my own website and make it really cool and fun. I would always just go the easy way and go to like Tumblr (blog) and just make a blog but with this class I can learn how to make my own website from sratch, not needing anything else.
